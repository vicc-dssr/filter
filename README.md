Follow-up Interactive Long-Term Expert Ranking (FILTER), is an online crowdsourcing platform where oncologists and other survivorship experts can adjudicate risk for complications in follow-up. Cases are synthetically generated based on lists of risk factors including demographics, treatments, genetics risks, and socioeconomic status. FILTER uses the Elo ranking algorithm (originally designed to rank chess players) to rank hypothetical patients by risk.
